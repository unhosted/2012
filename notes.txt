(?)
data in the accounts



## Difficulties getting started with remoteStorage.js & writing the first app
Nick Jennings, nkj, @slvrbckt

Historically didn’t like web apps, hosted by big companies.
Saw the talk in the list at CampusParty, liked it more the more I learnt about it
Overlooked connect widget
localStorage also new, no instructions for that at all atm (probs with clearing cache, looking at it, etc)
cube is not obvious, should better indicate current status (connected, problem, etc.)
Modules confusing, had to write own module, documentation on doing that not enough
How to do extensions to existing modules? Wanted to create bookmarking app for videos, needs not only core bookmark attributes, but also video metadata etc
Vidmarks app
bookmarks, metadata, of Youtube videos
https://github.com/silverbucket/vidmarks
to be deployed on 5apps.com
modules: videos, bookmarks, tags
Mashups of modules? E.g. bookmarks + videos + tags. (tags + anything)
What is the purpose of a module? Is there organized structure? Where does one end and begin? how do you enforce a data struct to ensure re-usability with other apps.
Used the todo list app to start out, but it didn't answer advanced / midlevel questions.



## App developer experience
Martin Stadler, @xMartin

Went to website, not clear what the current stable solutions are
Went to IRC, said you should use the new stuff, because the website/info is outdated
»I don’t care, I just want to start with a small thing to get it running.«
»Where’s the stable version?«
– Well, we don’t really support that anymore.
»stable« is actually not
you should use the new one, but that’s also not ready yet
lots of innovation, but we should also have something stable
a person or working group to support the stable stuff
official material should clearly distinguish between ideas and products
http://buddycloud.org developer wiki

TODO
https://github.com/unhosted/website/wiki/State-of-the-movement on website (Jan)
pay attention to keep info up to date and stable: Niklas remoteStorage.js, Jan website
improve remoteStoragejs.com: quick intro (Niklas, Martin, Basti, …?), better design (Jan)
website: list of app devs and contributors, and what they are interested in, to contact
monthly unhosted & remoteStorage meetup, starting in Berlin @ 5apps (Jan & Basti)
also check out apps.berlin.js (~140 people)
developer documentation: jsDoc (Niklas)
get everyone on 0.7 this weekend?
have short description for app devs: what’s 0.6.9, what’s 0.7.0?
link to actual wild apps instead of example apps
support 0.6.9 or 0.7.0? → follow-up session (Martin)



## SURFnet storage-first demo
Francois Kooman, @fkooman

»app store« on your storage servers (essentially a better OAuth token display)
list of Dutch universities
creates OAuth consent automatically when you add an app
everything is automatic, you don’t need to remember your user address
manifest files
module for apps, for moving to other storages
maybe add francois' portal permissions api to the 0.8 spec?



## Guidelines for apps & storages
Jan-Christoph Borchardt, @jancborchardt

https://github.com/unhosted/website/wiki/Guidelines - add more verbose explanation, also clearly say it's recommendations rather than rules

Apps
ideally do not use a server backend. While you can do it, don't (describe minutes.io situation)
open-source your app and freely license it. While you don’t need to, that way everyone learns and can help.
ideally use the connect widget, otherwise make sure to explain, and enable enter to log in
use existing, generic categories as much as possible (documents, contacts, pictures, …), not one just for your app
use AppCache for offline capability (easily done by deploying via 5apps)
cache content with localStorage (0.6.9)
use https for secure connections (startssl)
general OAuth issue (on sign out, notify people that they are still signed in to their storage. Provide a link so they can sign out there also.)
(polarizing recommendation) preferrably do not track usage. If you want to track usage, do it opt-in and anonymous – and then use a self-hosted solution (examples) rather than using a proprietary service (like Google Analytics)
for live-collaboration, you can use Socket.io as temporary hub (link to Websocket World idea). friends#unhosted is looking to pass messages fully distributed. (issue link)
make people aware of your app (even if it's only an experiment), post it to the mailing list, put it on webapp stores (for instance through 5apps.com)
enable users to undo latest changes (like deletion) but don't bother about revision history, as this is planned to be in remoteStorage.js (issue link)
don't ask for modules/data you don't really need, people will be more reluctant to use your app

Storage provider
give people easy addresses, like user@storage.com (rather than user-storage@storage.provider.com)
prefill username in OAuth process
persist tokens, an app should only need to be authorized once
storage-first: use the token list as an app dashboard, with icons and links to the apps
offer login + auth in one step to make the flow easier
do not offer checkboxes for app permissions - either the app works or not


remoteStorage.js support log in with provider domain
Webfinger needed? discover friends without: http://useraddress.net



## unhosted & FreedomBox
Markus Sabadello, @peacekeeper

http://freedomboxfoundation.org
0.1 just released
live demo!
put between inet connection and computers at home (connect to fb wifi)
Markus wants to demo some remotestorage implementation on it in a few weeks in Mountain View
need a reverse proxy like pagekite
maybe use unhosted.py or owncloud (debian package)
applied for https://www.accessnow.org/prize - result expected sep 15



## remoteStorage modules
Niklas Cathor, nilclass

extensibility
undo, versions
contacts, tags, bookmarks

need to clean up module boilerplate, require basic functions from a base module (e.g. UUID)
maybe add timestamps to all stored object by default
maybe add "updatePublicListing" functionality to the base client (for maintaining a public index of published items of a category)
[DONE] example server should have some output confirming the start after launching it
have to build rs.js on every module change atm, maybe improve (by waching/auto-building with grunt or sth)?
ran into "origin not allowed" – solution: got rid of local apache proxying, sudo node server on port 80  – if not existing, write proper instructions how to start local dev setup
(the problem seems to be, that apache doesn't proxy OPTIONS by default)
ran into format difference between local and remote change events
events with origin=window have Objects, the same event with origin=remote have the JSON source in newValue/oldValue

## When labels for consumer info go wrong
Hugo Roy, @hugoroyd
https://speakerdeck.com/u/hugo/p/when-labels-go-wrong



## Ideas & Products
Michiel de Jong, @michielbdejong

Ideas
http://useraddress.net
Webfinger-based
»the polyglot approach to the federated social web«
not a protocol, but a namespace in which everyone can operate
user@host, domain, or some kind of identifier
caches identities
http://opentabs.net
Bitcoins need to be produced, can be lost
decentralized transactions
beta test at Unhost via note app
Sockethub
real-time communication
message publishing
Websockets
WebRTC?
Apptorrent
distribute apps as if it was Bittorrent
peer-to-peer distribution of apps
like a recommendation, quality rating

Products
actually none, see next session

## Using remoteStorage not from a browser
elf Pavlik, elf-pavlik

export data from other web apps
If this then that (IFTTT) recipe to put your stuff on remoteStorage http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/09/true-data-liberation.html


## General discussion about user address and profile module

problem that user address is not an email address, we have to communicate that
cant use gravatar, mail from friendsunhosted dev
use a profiles module for name, image, email, Shared Stuff already has that info
modules for contacts and profile should be separate

TODO website Jan
roll back to Bootstrap version, fix layout issues
improve docs, check out emberjs.com



## Formats & distribution of unhosted web apps
Sebastian Kippe, binbasti, @skddc

Problem, storage provider window for chromeless app does not have an address bar, no way to verify its the actual app.
proposal: Storage providers should show some information only the user knows on the authorization page, so in case the dialog is chromeless, the user can still verify easily that it's actually the real provider. (does this actually make sense?)
